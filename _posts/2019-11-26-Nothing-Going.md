I will **make** a button with *javascript* that will, use an onClick() listener.
Upon clickage, you'll see a book, that i recommend reading, from a list. 
I'll probably publish the little database of books I've stared at on another page, *or something*. I'd also like to use emscripten to put one of leo's games into my site.
I'd also like to use bosonic, maybe some bootstrap, and learn more about web component.   


I'd also like to play with lazyily loaded images.

And one day in the future I want to build LN-LEo games...like asteroids with weekly highscore payouts.
