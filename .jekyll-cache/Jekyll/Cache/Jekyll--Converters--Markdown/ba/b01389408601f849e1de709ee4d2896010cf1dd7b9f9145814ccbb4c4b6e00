  <li>McHacks was fun. Met an SRE from google.</li>
  <li>Stopped thinking about the web-dev position at blockstream, though here I am, funded channels, and working on my site. Iâ€™ll probably apply soon.</li>
  <li>I learnt about JSON escaping while setting up Ride-The-Lightning, and talked to <a href="https://twitter.com/Suheb__"> @Suheb__</a> about it.</li>
  <li>Made my first LND payment. It was for 0.001 cents, so I better start looking for work.</li>
  <li>I learnt about JSON escape characters. â€˜\\â€™</li>
  <li>I finally got my hands a little dirty with CSS, and hopefully I keep working at that.</li>
  <li>Not restarting a localhost after making a  Î” Î” Î” to the config cost me an extra hour or so.</li>
  <li>Succeeeded in my <a href="https://github.com/bcongdon/awesome-lightning-network/pull/60"> Very First PR</a>, however trivial and submitted my <a href="https://github.com/Ride-The-Lightning/RTL/issues/252"> Very First Issue.</a></li>
