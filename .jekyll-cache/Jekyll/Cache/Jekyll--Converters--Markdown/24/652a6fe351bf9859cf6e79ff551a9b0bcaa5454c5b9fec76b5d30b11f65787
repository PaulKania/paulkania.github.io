I"‚<p>I Did a lot this month.<br />
I learnt how to use PGP, kleopatra, keybase. Some differences between .gpg files and .saltpack files.<br />
I made my 1st and 2nd JS programs, second also qualifying as my  first JS visualizer.<br />
I binge-played Rocket-League and got up to Silver I from Bronze III. I want to keep playing but Iâ€™m enjoying current projects too much right now.\</p>
