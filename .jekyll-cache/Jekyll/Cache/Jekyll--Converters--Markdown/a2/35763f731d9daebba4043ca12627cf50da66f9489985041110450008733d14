I"w<p>I will <strong>make</strong> a button with <em>javascript</em> that will, use an onClick() listener.
Upon clickage, you’ll see a book, that i recommend reading, from a list. 
I’ll probably publish the little database of books I’ve stared at on another page, <em>or something</em>. I’d also like to use emscripten to put one of leo’s games into my site.
I’d also like to use bosonic, maybe some bootstrap, and learn more about web component.</p>

<p>I’d also like to play with lazyily loaded images.</p>

<p>And one day in the future I want to build LN-LEo games…like asteroids with weekly highscore payouts.</p>
