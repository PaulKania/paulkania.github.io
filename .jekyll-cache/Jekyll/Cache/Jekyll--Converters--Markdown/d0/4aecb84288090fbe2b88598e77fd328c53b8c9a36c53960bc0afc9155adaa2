  <li>McHacks was fun. Met an SRE from google.</li>
  <li>Stopped thinking about the web-dev position at blockstream, though here I am, funded channels, and working on my site. Iâ€™ll probably apply soon.</li>
  <li>I learnt about JSON escaping while setting up Ride-The-Lightning, and talked to <a href="https://twitter.com/Suheb__"> @Suheb__</a> about it.</li>
  <li>Made my first LND payment. It was for 0.001 cents, so I better start looking for work.</li>
  <li>I learnt about JSON escape characters. â€˜\\â€™</li>
  <li>I finally got my hands a little dirty with CSS, and hopefully I keep working at that.</li>
