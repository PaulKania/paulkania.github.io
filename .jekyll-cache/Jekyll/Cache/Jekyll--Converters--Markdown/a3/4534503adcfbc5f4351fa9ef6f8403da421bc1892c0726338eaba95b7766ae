### Review:
* McHacks was fun. Met an SRE from google.
* Stopped thinking about the web-dev position at blockstream, though here I am, funded channels, and working on my site. I'll probably apply soon.
* I learnt about JSON escaping while setting up Ride-The-Lightning, and talked to <a href="https://twitter.com/Suheb__"> @Suheb__</a> about it.
* Made my first LND payment. It was for 0.001 cents, so I better start looking for work.
* I learnt about JSON escape characters. '\\\\'
* I finally got my hands a little dirty with CSS, and hopefully I keep working at that.
* Not restarting a localhost after making a  &#916; &#x394; &Delta; to the config cost me an extra hour or so.
* Succeeeded in my <a href="https://github.com/bcongdon/awesome-lightning-network/pull/60"> Very First PR</a>, however trivial and submitted my <a href="https://github.com/Ride-The-Lightning/RTL/issues/252"> Very First Issue.</a>
