<ul>
  <li>I transitioned to being fun-employed, giving me a ton more time to work on whatever I wanted to.</li>
  <li>Jess’s mum and aunt n uncle came to town, so that was fun.
    <ul>
      <li>I visited the part of town I used to live in, and crossed the Lachine Canal by foot, and snuck into the VanGogh ‘heaven’ room.</li>
      <li>Lots of equalization payment jokes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I turned 10,000 days old on New Years. Pretty proud of that one.</li>
  <li>I grok file systems a lot better than I used to, and configuring things no longer leads  me to immediate panic/withdrawl.</li>
  <li>I started AdventOfCode. Which (writing this in February) seems ridiculous, with how much I’ve grown, and more importantly, how much I expect from myself. Wow.</li>
</ul>
