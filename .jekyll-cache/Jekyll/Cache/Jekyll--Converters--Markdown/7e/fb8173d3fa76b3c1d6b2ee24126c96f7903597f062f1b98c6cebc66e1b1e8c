I"Ì<p>I will <strong>make</strong> a button with <em>javascript</em> that will, use an onClick() listener.
Upon clickage, youâ€™ll see a book, that i recommend reading, from a list. 
Iâ€™ll probably publish the little database of books Iâ€™ve stared at on another page, <em>or something</em>. Iâ€™d also like to use emscripten to put one of leoâ€™s games into my site.
Iâ€™d also like to use bosonic, maybe some bootstrap, and learn more about web component.</p>
