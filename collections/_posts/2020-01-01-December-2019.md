### Review

1. I transitioned to being fun-employed, giving me a ton more time to work on whatever I wanted to.
2. Jess's mum and aunt n uncle came to town, so that was fun.
    1. I visited the part of town I used to live in, and crossed the Lachine Canal by foot, and snuck into the VanGogh 'heaven' room.
    2. Lots of equalization payment jokes.
1. I turned 10,000 days old on New Years. Pretty proud of that one.
2. I grok file systems a lot better than I used to, and configuring things no longer leads  me to immediate panic/withdrawl.
3. I started AdventOfCode. Which (writing this in February) seems ridiculous, with how much I've grown, and more importantly, how much I expect from myself. Wow.
