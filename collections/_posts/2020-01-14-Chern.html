Midnight in Chernobyl ~540

A gigantic read worthy of the Soviet-Promethean gigantomania it studies.

It reads like science-horror fiction, I was usually in a state of slack-jawed disbelief. But this nightmare of a reality took place just over 1000km away from the majority of my family. Stillbirths around Europe in the months and years after, one must wonder. Three decades later, over half of the wild boar shot by hunters in the forests of the Czech Republic are still too radioactive for human consumption. There can be no justice for this.

Favorite parts include:
The complete and unceasing botch job of the Soviet government - dropping sand & lead from helicopters for instance.
When Forsmark asked if anybody had happen to fart large amounts of cesium 137 into the air.
Everytime Hans Blix/Hans Brix was mentioned.
The disregard in sending tens of thousands of conscripts to clear debris and generally expose themselves to early deaths. Like sending in a solider without a gun all over again.
Maria Protsenko’s diligent work ethic and the fact that she is still alive.

HBO’s Chernobyl, like virtually all TV adaptations, cut out details and misrepresent the truth. Just be prepared to reconsider who the baddies are. Dyatlov comes to mind.

“”Those who understood the threat eventually developed an unconscious habit of picking the tiniest specks of dust off clothes and tabletops—flicking them away in a constant, reflexive process of personal decontamination. But others remained unaware of the invisible dangers around them: soldiers lounged in the sun close to the reactor…Only the fate of the crows that had come to scavenge from the debris but stayed too long—and whose irradiated carcasses now littered the area around the plant—provided any visible warning of the costs of ignorance.””
