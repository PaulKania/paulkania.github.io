### Review
* I Did a lot this month.
* I made a Twitter Bot and a Twitter-based Deadmanswitch that measures activity and sends an email if activity hasn't occured in last x time.
* I learnt how to use PGP, kleopatra, keybase. Some differences between .gpg files and .saltpack files.
* I made my 1st and 2nd JS programs, second also qualifying as my  first JS visualizer.
* I binge-played Rocket-League and got up to Silver I from Bronze III. I want to keep playing but I'm enjoying current projects too much right now.
