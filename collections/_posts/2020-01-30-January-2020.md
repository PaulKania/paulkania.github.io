2. I learnt how to use PGP, kleopatra, keybase. Some differences between .gpg files and .saltpack files.
1. I made my 1st and 2nd JS programs, second also qualifying as my  first JS visualizer.
1. I binge-played Rocket-League and got up to Silver I from Bronze III. I want to keep playing but I'm enjoying current projects too much right now. &#128077;
