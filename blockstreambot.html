Methodology:<br>
keeping up -> use tweepy streaming API. then I won’t have to sort by age, and if the listening is constant, i dont have to set up a manual polling interval/<br>


so you can get user timeline (account_id, since_post_id, count). of each blockstream user.<br>
so for EACH user<br>
1.initialize unique sincepost_id # (see what there latest post is to initialize)<br>
	2. get user timeline (account_id, since_post_id, count).<br>
	3.retweet tweet.meat<br>
	4. update unique_since_post_id, (so that the next time you run the program, it pulls <br>
only more recent hits. you may have to save this post_id to a json file, because it’s not like you can automatically<br>
save python script after utilizing it...that would be a self-changing python script. makes more sense to go through a cycle of.<br>
pull data [pwuille: 1245939, halset: 123335,]<br>
check to see if more recent things have happened since (play with count to balance # of tweets per user. this is something you can tweek as time goes on, no need to perfect ir right away.<br>
push//overwrite the user:since id dictionary. bam should be a solid day project, knock on wood.<br>
use pickle to save and load the dictionary object -> relevnt s_overflow<br>
