	<p I will **make** a button with *javascript* that will, use an onClick() listener.
Upon clickage, you'll see a book, that i recommend reading, from a list. 
I'll probably publish the little database of books I've stared at on another page, *or something*.
 I'd also like to use emscripten to put one of leo's games into my site.
I'd also like to use bosonic, maybe some bootstrap, and learn more about web component</p>
